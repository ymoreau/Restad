# Restad #
## Relational Storage for Tagged Documents ##


**Project has moved to https://sourceforge.net/projects/restad/ and is now developped in C++/Qt.
The current repo will keep the Ruby-prototype version available but is not maintened anymore.**

The design goals of Restad are : XML documents should be stored without lost information, any well-formed XML document should be stored and queried, and query processing on fulltext or XML logical structure should be efficient.
